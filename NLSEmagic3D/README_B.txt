NLSE3D_TAKE_STEPS_XX_XX.cX
Program to integrate a chunk of time steps of the 3D Nonlinear Shrodinger Equation
i*Ut + a*(Uxx+Uyy+Uzz) - V(x)*U + s*|U|^2*U = 0

INPUT:
(U,V,s,a,h2,BC,chunk_size,k)
U  = Current solution matrix
V  = External Potential matrix
s  = Nonlinearity paramater
a  = Laplacian paramater
h2 = Spatial step size squared (h^2)
BC = Boundary condition selection switch:  1: Dirchilet 2: MSD 3: Lap=0
chunk_size = Number of time steps to take
k  = Time step size

OUTPUT:
U:  New solution matrix

Typical call:
U = NLSE3D_TAKE_STEPS_CD(U,V,s,a,h^2,BC,chunk_size,k);
